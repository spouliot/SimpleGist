# SimpleGist
A simple minimalistic gist client for C#

Nothing wrong with [Octokit.net](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net)
but it's a bit too big for my taste and my tools only needs so little of
it.

This was made in order to minimize dependencies and make it linker 
friendly.

* `Program.cs` is the test application
* `SimpleGist.cs` is the gist client that you can copy into your projects
